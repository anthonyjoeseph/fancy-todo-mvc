Check out my latest article - how to decide whether or not to use fp-ts Option vs undefined. I'd love to hear feedback!

Similar to my last article, this one explores the advantages of fp-ts Task. It outlines a set of rules for their maximum effectiveness.

fp-ts TaskEither is three things: an Either wrapped in a Promise wrapped in IO. I've written a series going into depth about each of these three things. Here's the first installment, exploring Either as a superior approach to error handling.

Here's the next installment in my series on fp-ts TaskEither, this time delving into Promise - why Promise is already great, and where TaskEither improves upon it.

Capping off my series on fp-ts TaskEither, this article investigates the lazy nature of TaskEither, and why it didn't take the same fork-able approach as Fluture (hint: Task is actually IO).

My next article builds on Tim Ecklund's great 'Beautiful API calls with fp-ts', representing errors as as union types and sum types. Hopefully it serves as a practical introduction to sum types as well as one of my favorite npm packages, @morphic-ts/adt

As we've discussed before, Option it doesn't trivially interoperate with nullables. It turns out this is because Option is a sum type, not as a simple union type. This article goes in depth into what this means and why this is actually a great thing.

When and why exactly is redux-observable worthwhile? Why is it like that? This is a complicated question. It's the culmination of many interrelated ideas, and it's inspired a few that succeed it. Here, I attempt to outline the relevant history:
